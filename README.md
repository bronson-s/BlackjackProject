## Week 4
### Blackjack APP

### Overview
For this project students were asked to create a functional command line
blackjack game. The game logic follows the rules of blackjack and implements
object oriented design. The game's class structure is designed to be reusable
without change if another card game is to be written.

### Concepts
* Enumerated Types
* Object oriented thought process and design.
* Collections: working with Lists (sorting and tuning)
* Exceptions (Try Catch blocks)
* Abstract Classes
* Calling methods between classes

## Lessons learned
For this project I gained confidence in the thought process behind OOP.
Having to think through the different potential Objects (nouns) and how they
interact with each other was helpful in understanding Object oriented design.

#### How to Run
To play blackjack user must run as java program within a JRE. Upon starting the
users and the players hands are populated with 2 cards each. Only the dealers
top card is displayed. Once presented with the console menu enter 1 to hit and 2
to stay. The dealer then hits a number of times related to the game logic.
Enter 1 to play again and 2 to quit.
